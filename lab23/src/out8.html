<br>History 
<br>
<br>With <b>the</b> other special <b>characters</b> <b>and</b> control codes filled in, <b>ASCII</b> was published as ASA X3.4-1963,
<br>leaving 28 code positions without any assigned meaning, reserved for future standardization,
<br><b>and</b> one unassigned control code.? There was some debate at <b>the</b> time whether
<br>there should be more control <b>characters</b> rather than <b>the</b> lowercase alphabet.?
<br>The indecision did not last long: during May 1963 <b>the</b> CCITT Working Party on <b>the</b> New Telegraph Alphabet
<br>proposed to assign lowercase <b>characters</b> to <b>sticks</b> 6 <b>and</b> 7, <b>and</b> International Organization
<br>for Standardization TC 97 SC 2 <b>voted</b> during October to incorporate <b>the</b> change into its draft standard.
<br>The X3.2.4 task group <b>voted</b> its approval for <b>the</b> change to <b>ASCII</b> at its May 1963 meeting.
<br>Locating <b>the</b> lowercase letters in <b>sticks</b> 6 <b>and</b> 7 caused <b>the</b> <b>characters</b> to differ in bit pattern
<br>from <b>the</b> upper <b>case</b> by a single bit, which simplified <b>case</b>-insensitive character matching
<br><b>and</b> <b>the</b> construction of keyboards <b>and</b> printers.</body></html>
